🧪 Selenium Automation Framework (Java | Maven | TestNG | Cucumber | POM)

This repository contains a fully implemented Selenium automation framework built using Java, Maven, TestNG, Cucumber, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
It was created as part of hands-on practice while following a Udemy automation testing course, with the goal of building a scalable, maintainable, and industry-standard test framework.

🔧 Key Features

Selenium WebDriver for browser automation

Java as the core programming language

Maven for dependency management and project build

TestNG for test execution, assertions, and reporting

Cucumber (BDD) for writing human-readable test scenarios (Gherkin syntax)

Page Object Model (POM) for clean, maintainable, reusable page classes

Configurable test runs with test suites

Modular and extensible project structure

🎯 Purpose

This project is intended for learning and practicing automation testing concepts taught in a Udemy course. It demonstrates best practices in modern test automation and serves as a foundation for future enhancements.

📁 Project Structure

src/main/java — Page Objects and core utilities

src/test/java — TestNG and Cucumber test runners and step definitions

src/test/java — Feature files and configuration files

🚀 How to Run
